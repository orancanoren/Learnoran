CPU &amp; GPU Parallelized Homomorphic Machine Learning API for C++

__Current Status:__ Microsoft SEAL integration almost done - however the framework is consuming non-practical resources.

## Project Roadmap

- [x] Build a proper machine library framework supporting linear regression
- [ ] __Integrete Microsoft SEAL into the library so that ML methods are capable of homomorphic processing__
- [ ] Expand the ML library to support ANN models
- [ ] Integrate homomorphic capabilities into the ANN models and parallelize training on CPUs
- [ ] Parallelize the library on GPUs
- [ ] Add multi-GPU support
- [ ] [*optional*] Extend the framework to Kubernetes environments
